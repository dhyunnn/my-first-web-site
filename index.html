<h2>WEB</h2>

WorldWideWeb (later renamed to Nexus to avoid confusion between the software and the World Wide Web) is the first web browser[1] and web page editor.[2] It was discontinued in 1994. At the time it was written, it was the sole web browser in existence,[1] as well as the first WYSIWYG HTML editor.

The source code was released into the public domain on 30 April 1993.[3][4] Some of the code still resides on Tim Berners-Lee's NeXT Computer in the CERN museum and has not been recovered due to the computer's status as a historical artifact.[5] To coincide with the 20th anniversary of the research center giving the web to the world, a project began in 2013 at CERN to preserve this original hardware and software associated with the birth of the Web.[6]
